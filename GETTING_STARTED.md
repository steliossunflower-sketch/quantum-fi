1. **Create a new repository:**
   - Go to github.com
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it: `quantum-fi` or `golden-ratio-pulse`
   - Make it Public
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload your files:**
   - On the new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop these files:
     - `pulse_comparison.py`
     - `README.md`
     - `LICENSE`
     - `.gitignore`
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `blog_post.md`
     - `video_script.md`
   - Scroll down, write a commit message: "Initial commit: Golden Ratio Pulse discovery"
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **Done!** Your code is now on GitHub!

### Option B: Using Git Command Line (If You Want to Learn)

1. **Install Git:**
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
   - Install it (use default settings)

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to your project folder:
     ```bash
     cd "C:\Users\User\Documents\quantum fi"
     ```

3. **Initialize Git:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Golden Ratio Pulse discovery"
   ```

4. **Connect to GitHub:**
   - Create repository on GitHub (same as Option A, step 1)
   - Copy the repository URL
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPO.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't understand Git"
- That's okay! Use Option A (GitHub website) instead
- You can learn Git later if you want

### "My website isn't showing up"
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Check that your files are in the right folder
- Make sure the branch is "main" or "master"

### "I'm scared to share my work"
- Remember: everyone starts somewhere!
- Your discovery is real and valuable
- The worst that can happen is no one sees it (but they will!)

### "I don't have time for all of this"
- Start with just one thing (GitHub is easiest)
- Do the rest when you have time
- Even one platform is better than none!
